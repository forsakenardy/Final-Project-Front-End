De-Ping-A-Pong is the place where players, amateurs or pros, can share together their love for this amazing sport. Let’s celebrate De-Ping-A-Pong!.
1. FIND
With De Ping-A-Pong you have the oportunity to create private matches with friends, make them public to look for rivals or look for events to join.
2. BOOK
We displayed an ELO system in which everybody starts with the same level, and fluctuates depending on the results of the matches. If you win, your ELO goes up, if not, it goes down. Having this in account, you will know who you are facing and that way you play leveled matches, knowing your playing level and your oponents, so you can grow faster and be more competitive.

###Technologies
- React
- JavaScript
- Vite
- Axios

We have used React to make up the components that contain the functions that will deploy the information written in JavaScript in the web app. Also Vite, a project generator that helps generating the files to write code. And, last but not least, Axios, which is a promise-based HTTP library that lets us, web-developers, to make requests to either our own or a third-party server to fetch data (in this case, just our own). It offers different ways of making requests such as GET , POST , PUT/PATCH , and DELETE (the CRUD).


###Components / Pages 

On one hand, we have used some components to create the navbar and the footer, as well as two more components to display the information and the functionalities wether you are logged or not (the isAnon, anonimous, or isPrivate, once you have logged in).

On the other hand, we have created the pages that are available to the users and the routes that helps getting into them (from the main .jsx file, app.jsx).


###Styles

Almost for every page we have created, we have displayed a .css file to style that page. Besides, we have used some of the styling components created in different areas and items (the buttons, for example, use the same styling in different pages).
